# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function or method will
# be called when a URL is accessed.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# highfive.menu_links.yml file.

# Example:
#   If the user accesses http://example.com/highfive/demo, the routing
#   system will look for a route the path of 'highfive/demo'.
#   In this case it will find a match, since we
#   define the highfive/demo path below on line 22.
#   Upon finding a path match, Drupal will execute the specified _controller callback.
#   In this case the callback is defined as a classname
#   "\Drupal\highfive\Controller\HighFiveController" and the method of the class
#   "tutorial".

# Notice that the user must have the permission we defined in highfive.permissions.yml
# That permission has the machine name of 'access highfive demo'.
